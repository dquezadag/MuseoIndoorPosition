# University of Alacal√° Indoor Positioning APP

### Overview 

This is a functional Android application built using Mapbox.

### Disclaimer

1. It contains [Mapbox SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/) and it has its own support Mapping applications.

2. This application is just another way to build an Indoor App by using different libraries to develop an application on the fly. Be aware this is not meant to be a blueprint, the correct way, even worse, the best way to build an IPS. On the contrary, it was built purely for fun and curiosity. Indeed, there are plenty of different ways to create a similar project using OSM, Google Maps, ARCGIS, among others. However, I hope this can be useful offering some guidance for those trying to build Indoor APPs.
